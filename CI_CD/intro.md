**CI/CD** pipeline helps automate software delivery and ensure reliable releases.   


**Plan:**  
This involves organizing tasks and requirements, often managed through tools like JIRA or Trello.    
Ensure the team is prepared for what needs to be developed or fixed in upcoming iterations.  
Tools: Jira, Trello

**Code:**   
Developers write code to add new features or fix bugs.   
This is the initial step where changes are made to the software.       
Tools: GitHub, GitLab

**Build:**   
The code is compiled, or built, into executable programs or other runnable pieces of software.  
This step checks whether the codebase integrates correctly.  
Tools: Jenkins

**Test:**   
Automated tests are run against the built software to ensure it behaves as expected.   
This includes unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes end-to-end tests.  
Tools: Pytest

**Release:**  
The software is packaged and prepared for release.   
This stage often involves setting up release notes, finalizing versions, and handling other administrative tasks necessary for a smooth launch.  
Tools: JFrog Artifactory

**Deploy:**  
The process of deploying the software to production servers.   
This could be automated to allow for frequent and reliable deployments without manual intervention.  
Tools: Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes

**Operate:**   
Ongoing maintenance and regular updates are performed to keep the system running smoothly.   
This includes managing resources, performing scaling operations, and ensuring that the system responds well under varying loads.  
Tools: Puppet, Chef

**Monitor:**   
Once the software is released, its performance is monitored to ensure it operates correctly in production.   
This includes tracking uptime, errors, and other critical metrics.  
Tools: Prometheus, Grafana
