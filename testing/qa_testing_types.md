**Unit testing:**       
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested 
in isolation to ensure that they function correctly. In the context of programming, a "unit" typically refers 
to a single function, method, or a small piece of code. The primary goal of unit testing is 
to validate that each unit of code behaves as expected.

**Integration testing:**  
Integration testing is a software testing technique that focuses on verifying the interactions and interfaces between
different components, modules, or services within a software application. 
The primary goal of integration testing is to ensure that these integrated parts work together correctly as a whole. 
Unlike unit testing, which tests individual units of code in isolation, integration testing evaluates 
the interactions between these units when they are combined.

**Regression testing:**  
Regression testing is a software testing technique focused on ensuring that new code changes or feature additions do not adversely 
affect existing functionality. It involves retesting parts of an application that have been modified to verify that 
no new defects or issues have been introduced. The primary goal of regression testing is to maintain the quality and stability of 
the software throughout its development lifecycle.

**Performance Testing:**   
Performance testing is a type of software testing that assesses the performance, scalability, and responsiveness 
of a software application under different conditions. The primary goal of performance testing is to ensure that 
an application functions optimally and meets its performance requirements, especially under expected and peak loads. 
Performance testing helps identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, and areas for improvement to enhance the overall user experience.

**Acceptance testing:**
Acceptance testing is a crucial phase in the software testing process that focuses on determining whether a software 
application or system meets the specified business requirements and is ready for deployment. 
It is typically one of the final stages of testing before software is released to end-users or customers. 
The primary objective of acceptance testing is to ensure that the software delivers value and functions 
as expected from the user's perspective.

**Mocking Test:**  
Mocking in software testing is a technique used to simulate or replace certain components, dependencies, or external services 
with "mock objects" or "mocks." The primary purpose of mocking is to isolate the unit or component being tested from 
its external dependencies or collaborators, allowing for controlled and repeatable testing of specific functionality. 
Mocking is commonly used in unit testing and integration testing.
