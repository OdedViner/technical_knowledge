**Linux boot process:**

1.BIOS/UEFI: When you turn on the computer, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or 
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is activated. It performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) 
to check hardware components and locate the boot device.

2.Boot Loader: The BIOS/UEFI hands over control to the boot loader, 
which is typically GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) in most Linux distributions. 
The boot loader presents a menu (if configured) and allows the user to choose the operating system to boot.

3.Kernel Initialization: Once the boot loader has loaded the selected kernel into memory, 
it decompresses it and transfers control to the kernel. 
The kernel is the core of the operating system, and it starts initializing 
various components, such as memory management, devices, and drivers.

4.Initramfs/Initrd (Initial RAM File System): For some Linux distributions, 
an initramfs or initrd is used. This is a temporary file system loaded into memory, 
containing essential drivers and tools needed to mount the actual root file system.
 It ensures that the kernel can access the necessary drivers to mount the root file system,
  especially if it's on an encrypted or complex storage setup.

5.Root File System Mount: The kernel then mounts the actual root file system as specified in the boot parameters.
 This is the main file system that contains the complete operating system.

6.Init Process: After mounting the root file system, the kernel starts the first userspace process called "init" or its 
modern replacements like "systemd" or "upstart." The init process is assigned process ID 1 and acts as the parent 
to all other processes, ensuring that the system reaches a functional state.

7.Runlevel or Target Initialization: The init process is responsible for bringing the system 
to a specific runlevel (older systems) or a target (modern systems). The runlevel or target defines 
the system's state and services. Different runlevels/targets determine which services should start or stop during boot.

8.Service Initialization: Based on the runlevel/target, 
the init process starts various daemons and services required for the system's operation, 
such as networking, system logging, and more.

9.Login Manager (Graphical Mode): If the system is set to boot into a graphical user interface (GUI), 
the login manager (e.g., GDM, LightDM) is started, presenting the login screen for user authentication.

10.User Session (Graphical Mode): After successful login, 
the desktop environment or window manager specified by the user is loaded, providing the graphical user interface.
