**Taints and Tolerations are used to control which nodes can or cannot run certain pods.**

Taints are applied to nodes
Tolerations are set on pods to indicate that they can tolerate nodes with specific taints

This mechanism helps in ensuring that certain pods are scheduled on specific nodes or node groups.


**Taint a Node:**
Let's assume you want to taint a node with a key "specialnode" and value "true".

```
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> specialnode=true:NoSchedule
```

This taint ensures that no pod will be scheduled on this node unless the pod has a matching toleration.

**Create a Pod with Toleration:**

Now, when you create a pod that should run on this specific node, you need to add 
a toleration to the pod specification. 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "specialnode"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```


In this example, the pod has a toleration for the taint with key "specialnode," 
value "true," and effect "NoSchedule." This means the pod can tolerate nodes
with the specified taint, and it won't be scheduled on nodes without this taint.
