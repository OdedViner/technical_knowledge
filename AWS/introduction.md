Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, on which they can run their own applications. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud, allowing users to easily scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand.

Key features of EC2 include:

Elasticity: Users can quickly scale capacity both up and down as computing requirements change.

Variety of Instance Types: EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose computing, memory-intensive applications, CPU-intensive tasks, and more.

Pricing Options: Users can choose from various pricing options, including on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances, allowing them to optimize costs based on their usage patterns.

Security: EC2 provides a range of security features, including network security groups, firewalls, encryption, and identity and access management (IAM) policies, to help users secure their instances and data.

Integration with Other AWS Services: EC2 integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon VPC, allowing users to build comprehensive cloud-based solutions.

Customization: Users have full control over the configuration of their EC2 instances, including the choice of operating system, storage options, and networking settings.
